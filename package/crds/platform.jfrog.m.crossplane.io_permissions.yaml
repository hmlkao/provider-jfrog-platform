                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It will be honored

                  InitProvider holds the same fields as ForProvider, with the exception
                  of Identifier and other resource reference fields. The fields that are
                  in InitProvider are merged into ForProvider when the resource is created.
                  The same fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to
                  avoid updating them after creation. This is useful for fields that are
                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after creation,
                  for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an
                  autoscaler.

                                    **SCAN** Xray Metadata: Triggers Xray scans on Release Bundles. Creates and deletes custom issues and license.
                                    **MANAGE**: Allows changing Release Bundle permission settings for other users in this permission target. It does not permit adding/removing resources to the permission target.
