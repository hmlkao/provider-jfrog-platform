            audience: (String) Sets of (space separated) the JFrog services to which the mapping applies. Default value is *@*, which applies to all services.
            claims_json: (String) Claims JSON from the OIDC provider. Use Terraform jsonencode function to encode the JSON string. Claims constitute the payload part of a JSON web token and represent a set of information exchanged between two parties. The JWT standard distinguishes between reserved claims, public claims, and private claims. In API Gateway context, both public claims and private claims are considered custom claims. For example, an ID token (which is always a JWT) can contain a claim called that asserts that the name of the user authenticating is "John Doe". In a JWT, a claim appears as a name/value pair where the name is always a string and the value can be any JSON value.
            description: (String) Description of the OIDC mapping
            expires_in: (Number) Token expiry time in seconds. Default value is 60.
            groups_pattern: (String) Provide a pattern which is used to map OIDC groups to Artifactory groups.
            name: (String) Name of the OIDC identity mapping
            priority: (Number) Priority of the identity mapping. The priority should be a number. The higher priority is set for the lower number. If you do not enter a value, the identity mapping is assigned the lowest priority. We recommend that you assign the highest priority (1) to the strongest permission gate. Set the lowest priority to the weakest permission for a logical and effective access control setup.
            project_key: (String) If set, this Identity Mapping will be available in the scope of the given project (editable by platform admin and project admin). If not set, this Identity Mapping will be global and only editable by platform admin. Once set, the projectKey cannot be changed.
            provider_name: (String) Name of the OIDC configuration
            scope: (String) Scope of the token. Must start with applied-permissions/user, applied-permissions/admin, applied-permissions/roles:, or applied-permissions/groups:. Group names must be comma-separated, double quotes wrapped, e.g. applied-permissions/groups:\"readers\",\"my-group\", Role permissions are only applicable when in project scope and must be comma-separated, double quotes wrapped, e.g. applied-permissions:roles:<project-key>:"Developer","Viewer". username` is also required when setting role permission.
            token_spec: (Attributes) Specifications of the token. In case of success, a token with the following details will be generated and passed to OIDC Provider. (see below for nested schema)
            username: (String) User name of the OIDC user. Not applicable when scope is set to applied-permissions/groups. Must be set when scope is set to applied-permissions/roles.
            username_pattern: (String) Provide a pattern which is used to map OIDC user to Artifactory user.

        argumentDocs:
            allow_user_to_access_profile: (Boolean) When set, auto created users will have access to their profile page and will be able to perform actions such as generating an API key. Default value is false.
            auto_redirect: (Boolean) When set, clicking on the login link will direct users to the configured SAML login URL. Default value is false.
            auto_user_creation: (Boolean) When set, authenticated users are automatically created in Artifactory. When not set, for every request from an SSO user, the user is temporarily associated with default groups (if such groups are defined), and the permissions for these groups apply. Without automatic user creation, you must manually create the user inside Artifactory to manage user permissions not attached to their default groups. Default value is true.
            certificate: (String, Sensitive) The certificate for SAML Authentication in Base64 format. NOTE! The certificate must contain the public key to allow Artifactory to verify sign-in requests.
            email_attribute: (String) If auto_user_creation is enabled or an internal user exists, the system will set the user's email to the value in this attribute that is returned by the SAML login XML response.
            enable: (Boolean) When set, SAML integration is enabled and users may be authenticated via a SAML server. Default value is true.
            group_attribute: (String) The group attribute in the SAML login XML response. Note that the system will search for a case-sensitive match to an existing group..
            ldap_group_settings: (Set of String) List of LDAP group setting names. Only support in Artifactory 7.98 or later. See Enabling Synchronization of LDAP Groups for SAML SSO for more details.
            login_url: (String) The identity provider login URL (when you try to login, the service provider redirects to this URL).
            logout_url: (String) The identity provider logout URL (when you try to logout, the service provider redirects to this URL).
            name: (String) SAML Settings name.
            name_id_attribute: (String) The username attribute used to configure the SSO URL for the identity provider.
            service_provider_name: (String) The SAML service provider name. This should be a URI that is also known as the entityID, providerID, or entity identity.
            sync_groups: (Boolean) When set, in addition to the groups the user is already associated with, he will also be associated with the groups returned in the SAML login response. Note that the user's association with the returned groups is not persistent. It is only valid for the current login session. Default value is false.
            use_encrypted_assertion: (Boolean) When set, an X.509 public certificate will be created by Artifactory. Download this certificate and upload it to your IDP and choose your own encryption algorithm. This process will let you encrypt the assertion section in your SAML response. Default value is false.
            verify_audience_restriction: (Boolean) Set this flag to specify who the assertion is intended for. The "audience" will be the service provider and is typically a URL but can technically be formatted as any string of data. Default value is true.
